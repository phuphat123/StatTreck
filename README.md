<span style="color:darkorange"> StatTrek </span>
StatTrek is a mobile application designed to help users to see an overview of their activities, such as where they have travelled, what apps have they been using, etc. StatTrek's motivation was originally supposed to collect data linked to Mental Health. For example, when GPS location hasn't moved can imply that the user has bad mental health.
